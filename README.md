# PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization

## Overview
This project aims to develop a user-friendly tool for visualizing and exploring PhonePe Pulse data. It utilizes Streamlit and Plotly for the front-end interface and dynamic visualizations, respectively. Data retrieval, transformation, storage in SQL, and dynamic visualization in Streamlit are seamlessly integrated to offer a comprehensive tool for exploring PhonePe Pulse data.

## Key Features
- Data retrieval from PhonePe's Repo via Git Clone.
- Transformation of JSON data to Pandas DataFrames.
- Conversion of data to CSV format for local accessibility.
- Integration with PostgreSQL for efficient data storage.
- Development of an interactive Streamlit app for user-friendly data exploration.
- Implementation of Plotly for dynamic visualizations, including Choropleth maps.
- User interaction enabling selection options in the Streamlit interface.
- Execution of back-end queries based on user selections to fetch and process data from SQL.
- Real-time presentation of visual insights within the Streamlit interface.

## Workflow
1. **Data Retrieval and Transformation:**
   - Clone PhonePe Pulse data from the repository.
   - Convert JSON to CSV for local accessibility.
  
2. **SQL Integration:**
   - Establish a PostgreSQL connection.
   - Create tables and transfer data for efficient storage.

3. **Streamlit Application:**
   - Develop an interactive Streamlit app for data exploration.
   - Implement dynamic visualizations using Plotly.

4. **User Interaction and Query Processing:**
   - Enable user selection options in the Streamlit interface.
   - Execute back-end queries to fetch and process data from SQL.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Present visual insights in real-time within the Streamlit interface.
   - Utilize Choropleth maps and other Plotly visualizations for effective data representation.

## Usage
